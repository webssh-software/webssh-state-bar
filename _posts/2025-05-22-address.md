Simple script that retrieves the resolved SSH connection IP address. It uses the `$vars.get` method to access the `WEBSSH_CONNECTION_ADDRESS` variable, which contains the IP address of the current SSH connection. This can be useful for quickly checking the IP address of the connected host without needing to run additional commands or scripts.
